tclayson-Wordpress-Branding
===========================

Wordpress plugin to brand the backend

tclayson Wordpress Theme
------------------------

Located at `wp-content/themes/tclayson` this theme is a standard HTML reset theme. It is completely blank and, although it has a minimal layout I find that this is an adequate starting place for any website.

_**Disclaimer:** This is not my own work. Although I may have made minor modifications to it over the years, it is largely the work of someone else. However I have had it for a long time and have used it in many different projects and websites and cannot remember where I got it from, only that it has been passed around between my different projects. Obviously if this is your work let me know and I will credit you accordingly._

tclayson-admin Plugin
---------------------

Located at `wp-content/plugins/tclayson-admin` this plugin allows you to brand and take control of your admin section at a low level. This includes branding it with your own logos and hiding some menu items/update notifications and such. Your clients don't want to be baffled by the whole admin section, they only want what they need to get by, this is the answer to that.
